# JOE
Download job postings from JOE Listings (Job Openings for Economists)
This python file simplifies the process of searching for posts on JOE. 
It extracts key details and exports them into excel so that you can easily sort
and pick the jobs you like. The format is user-friendly.
For international students/postings, I have included a column that indicates whether 
there are citizenship requirements for a given post.
You can sort jobs by deadlines - important since JOE doesn't allow this
You can view details on review process - some jobs start reviewing applications before deadlines
Fields included:Institution', 'Position','Date Posted','Application Deadline','Location','Country',
   'Citizenship Requirements','Review Date','Application Requirements'
Range: Extracted jobs are limited to those between: August 1, 2020 - Jan 31, 2021
